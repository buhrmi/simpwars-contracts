# The Simp Wars

> When simps go to the moon ðŸš€

Hello and welcome. This repo contains the smart contract that allows anyone to tokenize Twitch streamers on the Ethereum blockchain. A tokenized streamer is called a simp. Simps are needed to participate in the upcoming [SimpWars](https://github.com/buhrmi/simpwars).

The initial minting cost is 1 ETH and doubles every time a new simp is minted. To prevent the price from skyrocketing the price gradually decreases by 50% every 24 hours.

No simps are pre-minted and can be minted by whoever wants them. You can use the `price` function to check the current cost to mint a simp. To actually mint a simp, call the `mint` function with the Twitch User ID and pay the required amount of Eth. If you submit too much Eth, the contract will send the remaining Eth back to you.

## Simp Powerlevel

Every 24 hours, your simps emit 10 Power Tokens (PT). These Power Tokens can be burned to increase your simps' on-chain powerlevel. A higher powerlevel gives your simp more power to survive in combat during the upcoming SimpWars.

To increase the powerlevel, call the `powerup` function with the simp ID and the amount of Powerup Tokens you would like to burn. You can powerup simps that you own yourself, and also your friend's simps that have `powerupAccepted` set to true.

### Contract Address

The contract is not yet deployed. This will happen live on stream at a future date. Please join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VH2haTs) for announcements.

## How to deploy

This is a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) project. To deploy (for example on Rinkeby) run 

```
npx hardhat run --network Rinkeby scripts/deploy.js
```

you can then verify the contract on Etherscan with

```
npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

## Running tests

The tests can be run with 

```
npx hardhat test
```
